# Design Requirements

<!-- Replace the example content below with your project's actual requirements. -->
<!-- The structure is a suggestion — adapt sections to fit your project. -->

## Overview

<!-- One or two sentences describing what you're building and the core constraints. -->

> **Example**: A compact, weather-resistant garden shed optimized for flat-pack shipping and tool-free assembly. Target footprint under 64 sq ft.

## Dimensions

<!-- Key dimensions and spatial constraints. Include units. -->

> **Example**:
> - **Footprint**: 8' x 8' (2438mm x 2438mm)
> - **Overall height**: 9' (2743mm)
> - **Door opening**: 36" wide x 80" tall

## Functional Requirements

<!-- What the design must do. Include fit criteria where possible — how would you verify each requirement is met? -->

> **Example**:
> - Must support 30 psf roof snow load (verified by structural calc)
> - All panels must fit through a standard 36" doorway (verified by max panel dimension check)
> - Assembly time under 4 hours for two people (verified by timed test build)

## Design Priorities

<!-- Ranked list of what matters most when trade-offs arise. -->

> **Example**:
> 1. **Ease of assembly** — no specialized tools, minimal fasteners
> 2. **Portability** — flat-pack, shippable via standard freight
> 3. **Durability** — weather-resistant for year-round outdoor use

## Open Questions

<!-- Unresolved items. Check these off or move to decisions.md as they're answered. -->

> **Example**:
> - [ ] Roofing material: metal panels vs. asphalt shingles?
> - [ ] Foundation: concrete piers vs. gravel pad vs. skids?
> - [ ] Finish: paint vs. stain vs. natural weathering?
