# Specifications

Precise, measurable values that have been locked in through the design process. Requirements describe _what_ and _why_; specifications describe the exact _how much_. Move values here from `requirements.md` once they're finalized.

<!-- Replace the example content below with your project's actual specifications. -->

## Dimensions

<!-- Final dimensions with tolerances where applicable. -->

> **Example**:
>
> | Element | Value | Tolerance | Notes |
> |---------|-------|-----------|-------|
> | Overall width | 2438mm (8'-0") | +/- 3mm | Outer frame dimension |
> | Overall depth | 2438mm (8'-0") | +/- 3mm | Outer frame dimension |
> | Overall height | 2743mm (9'-0") | +/- 5mm | Ground to ridge |
> | Door opening | 914mm x 2032mm | +/- 2mm | Clear opening |

## Materials

<!-- Finalized material selections with part numbers or specs where available. -->

> **Example**:
>
> | Component | Material | Specification | Supplier |
> |-----------|----------|---------------|----------|
> | Frame | Steel square tubing | 2" x 2" x 14ga | — |
> | Roof panels | Corrugated galvanized steel | 26ga, 36" coverage | — |
> | Fasteners | Self-drilling screws | #12 x 1", rubber washer | — |

## Tolerances & Standards

<!-- General tolerances and any standards the design must conform to. -->

> **Example**:
> - Steel fabrication: +/- 1mm on cut lengths, +/- 0.5deg on angles
> - Assembly fit: all panels must align within 3mm at joints
> - Load rating: 30 psf roof live load per IBC Table 1607.1
